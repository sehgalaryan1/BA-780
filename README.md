This project aims to explore the correlation between financial statement variables and future stock performance, specifically examining how Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can predict stock returns. The study challenges the notion that it's impossible to "beat the market" by providing insights on how investors can make more informed decisions based on financial data. By analyzing the relationship between annual stock returns and changes in financial statement variables, the project will create ratios from key financial metrics and identify the most influential factors on stock performance. In contrast to day trading strategies that rely on stock chart patterns and arbitrary metrics, this project integrates quantitative investing techniques with an in-depth look at company operations, offering a more reliable investment strategy based on company quality. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that go beyond traditional investing methodologies, similar to the strategies used by successful hedge funds.
